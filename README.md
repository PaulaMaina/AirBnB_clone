**AirBnB_clone Project**

**Overview**

The AirBnB clone project demonstrates different concepts learned in Python.
It portrays the use of classes, inheritance, serialization, and deserialization,
using unit tests to validate the project's classes, functions, methods,
and storage engine.

The project entails developing a command interpreter that works the same
way a Python interpreter works. The console created should execute
commands such as EOF, create, all, quit, help, destroy, and update.

It should be able to effectively and efficiently execute the commands
in interactive and non-interactive mode.
